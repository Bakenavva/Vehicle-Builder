# Vehicle-Builder

## Description

This is an interactive application that allows the user to utilize pre-built vehicles, or to create their own. After intializing their selection, the user will then be able to perform a number of actions via the console. 

Certain actions require specific conditions suchas:
- A car cannot be driven if it has not been started
- Towing requires a "Truck"
- Wheelie requires a "Motorbike"

This project is heavily reliant on the command-line application, AND the node.js [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). For this reason, the program must first be initialized through node package manager before the application can function. [Instructions](#instructions) ahead!
